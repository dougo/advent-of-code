# advent-of-code
My solutions in Ruby for the puzzles at [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/).

SPOILER ALERT! Don't read the code in the `lib` directory if you haven't already solved the puzzles yourself.

To print a puzzle's answer(s), run the source file: `ruby lib/day-1-not-quite-lisp.rb`. Note that this will use my
personalized input data, which is probably different from yours.

Run all the tests with `rake`. Or run a single test file with `rake TEST=test/test-day-1-not-quite-lisp`.
